A high compatibility iOS mwsdk. All code is written by Objective-C.

You can not only use this in your Unity project but also in your origin XCode projects.  
*But note that this framework only supports two functionalities: login and wallet opening. If you require more comprehensive features, please refrain from attempting to use this package. Instead, reach out to us, as we may have alternative solutions to make it compatible with your game version.*
